# MomenDev
We are building a chrome extension similar to momentum with react.

## Developing mode
* npm install
* npm run dev
* copy "chrome://extensions/" into browser adress line
* toggle developer mode
* load unpacked extension and use the dist-folder in the git folder
* the extension runs by opening a new tab, or by clicking the extension-icon (default grey M right now)
